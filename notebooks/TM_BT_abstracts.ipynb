       "'Many multi-agent scenarios require message sharing among agents to promote coordination, hastening the robustness of multi-agent communication when policies are deployed in a message perturbation environment. Major relevant studies tackle this issue under specific assumptions, like a limited number of message channels would sustain perturbations, limiting the efficiency in complex scenarios. In this paper, we take a further step in addressing this issue by learning a robust cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning via multi-view message certification, dubbed CroMAC. Agents trained under CroMAC can obtain guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values to identify and choose the optimal action under a worst-case deviation when the received messages are perturbed. Concretely, we first model multi-agent communication as a multi-view problem, where every message stands for a view of the state. Then we extract a certificated joint message representation by a multi-view variational autoencoder (MVAE) that uses a product-of-experts inference network. For the optimization phase, we do perturbations in the latent space of the state for a certificate guarantee. Then the learned joint message representation is used to approximate the certificated state representation during training. Extensive experiments in several cooperative multi-agent benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed CroMAC.'"

      "Abstract:Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems have gained significant attention in applications, such as aerial surveillance and search and rescue missions. With the recent development of state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, it is possible to train multi-UAV systems in collaborative and competitive environments. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of multiagent systems pose significant privacy and security risks when deploying general and conventional MARL algorithms. The presence of even a single Byzantine adversary within the system can severely degrade the learning performance of UAV agents. This work proposes a Byzantine-resilient MARL algorithm that leverages a combination of geometric median consensus and a robust state update model to mitigate, or even eliminate, the influence of Byzantine attacks. To validate its effectiveness and feasibility, the authors include a multi-UAV threat model, provide a guarantee of robustness, and investigate key attack parameters for multiple UAV navigation scenarios. Results from the experiments show that the average rewards during a Byzantine attack increased by up to 60% for the cooperative navigation scenario compared with conventional MARL techniques. The learning rewards generated by the baseline algorithms could not converge during training under these attacks, while the proposed method effectively converged to an optimal solution, proving its viability and correctness.Keywords:Byzantine attack;multiagent reinforcement learning;multi-UAV system\n"
